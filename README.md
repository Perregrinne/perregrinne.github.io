Services:
[Citation Generator](https://perregrinne.github.io/Citation-Generator/): Automatically generates APA or MLA format citations for your bibliography.

Projects:

[Web Mill](https://github.com/Perregrinne/Web-Mill): I intend for this to be an alternative to Wordpress. The goal is to make something very easy to use and much less bloated and way more efficient. A nice feature about this is that it will not try to stop you from making changes to the code, unlike Wordpress.

[Static Nexus](https://github.com/Perregrinne/StaticNexus): This website generator focuses only on static websites. It will put together your HTML, CSS, and Javascript for you. Other than this, it will function very much the same as Web Mill.

Miscellaneous Stuff:

[Blend of Things](https://github.com/Perregrinne/Blend-of-things): My repository for all things Blender-related. It contains Python scripts for procedurally generating meshes such as slides, shurikens, simple buildings, etc. It also contains hundreds of 3D models that anyone is free to use (however, they are untextured).
